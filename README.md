#### Further reading

For additional resources on getting up to speed in Python, I highly recommend Jake's book _A Whirlwind Tour of Python_, which is [currently available for free](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf). If you're ready to go deeper, there are [many freely available books on Python to try](http://pythonbooks.revolunet.com).
